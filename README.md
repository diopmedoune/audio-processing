# Noise Reduction and Audio Processing  
 
This project focuses on noise reduction and audio processing techniques, including:  
- Detecting abnormal noise patterns  
- Reducing unwanted audio noise  
- Compressing audio files efficiently  
- Implementing anomaly detection in audio signals  

The project is built using Django for the web interface and integrates various audio processing techniques.  

## Features  
- **Abnormal Noise Detection**: Identifies unexpected noise patterns in audio files  
- **Audio Compression**: Compresses audio files while maintaining quality  
- **Noise Reduction**: Applies filtering techniques to remove unwanted noise
